# BlackJack Game

##DESCRIPTION
1. HTML and CSS are used for the blackjack platform.
2. JQUERY is utilized to show the logic of the game.

## DEVELOPER THOUGHT
1. This app was created with emphasize on JQUERY usage.
2. Javascript being an asynchronous language is helpful but this also means that the game event order is developer's responsibility.
3. Use of functions and JQUERY property commands for game event order is a critical component of this app.
4. As I am thinking through the coding, many lines are duplicated and use of function/class and calling them as needed can and will make a cleaner code for review and modification. (future adjustment)



## How to Use
1. Click start then deal to start the game. 
2. RESET OPTION is always available(User's starting total chip varies from 100 to 600).
3. After hitting the deal button, you will be able to see your hand and option to bet will be available. 
4. Depending on your hand, choose your next move(deal / hit / stand).
5. Your goal is to get your total chip value to go higher than 1,000.
